# Basic Mapping engine for Flutter
This library supplies a basic implementation of a tiled mapping engine for flutter. There is a basic openstreetmap widget available which can be set on a specific geographic location. Basic gestures are implemented to pan and zoom this map.
More advanced options are available for adding markers and vector based object like lines and circles.

- Version: 0.0.1

## Installation

    dependencies:
         mapping_library: any

## Examples

**Basic Example**
```
    
    import 'package:mapping_library/Widgets/OsmMap.dart';
    import 'package:mapping_library/utils/geopoint.dart';
    import 'package:mapping_library/utils/mapposition.dart';
    
    // Build a stateless widget 
    // and add the OsmMap widget to the build function like this
    // This Geopoint is a location in the middle of the Netherlands
    
    
    @override  
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {  
        return MaterialApp(  
            title: 'Flutter Demo',  
            theme: ThemeData(  
                primarySwatch: Colors.blue,  
            ),  
            home: Container(   
                child: OsmMap(  
                    mapPosition: new MapPosition.Create(  
                    geoPoint: new GeoPoint(52.45657243868931, 5.52041338863477),  
                    scale: 11,  
                    )  
                ),  
            )  
        );  
    }
    
```

There are three callback methods:
  
- mapReady (Fired when the map initially is created, needed when you want to add more layers)
- mapPositionChanged (Fired as soon as the position or zoom of the map is changed)    
**Return**: Viewport object, this holds both the current MapPosition as the visual BoundingBox of the current map 
- mapTabbed (Fired when you tab on the map)    
**Return**: GeoPoint object, this holds the geographic location of the position tabbed.

**Advanced examples**

If you want to do more advanced stuff you need to create all the objects in the contructor of the Widget like this:

Define a MapView variable, Create this new object in the apps constructor and add the mapReady event handler.

```

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  MyApp() : super() {
    _mapView = new mapview.MapView(_mapReady);
  }

  // Define a Mapview
  mapview.MapView _mapView;

  _mapReady(mapview.MapView mapView) {
  }
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Container(
        child: _mapView
      )
    );
  }
}

```

Continue by adding code to the mapReady callback function. First create
a base Layer. This normally should be a TileLayer. Define a http source
where the tiles are served from, Create a new HttpTileSource and finally
create a new TileLayer using this source.

```
_mapReady(mapview.MapView mapView) {
    final _url = "http://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/##Z##/##X##/##Y##.png";
    HttpTileSource osmTileSource = new HttpTileSource(_url); TileLayer
    tileLayer = new TileLayer(osmTileSource); _mapView.AddLayer(tileLayer);
    //
    //
    }
```

Create a new MapPosition to initially more and zoom the map to a chosen
default location. Create a new GeoPoint with the chosen geographic
location and use this with the desired zoomlevel to create a new
MapPosition. Set the mapview to this new MapPosition.

```
GeoPoint s = new GeoPoint(52.45657243868931, 5.52041338863477);
MapPosition _initialPosition = MapPosition.fromGeopointScale(s, 11);
_mapView.SetMapPosition(_initialPosition);
```
